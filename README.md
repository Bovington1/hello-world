# hello-world
This is a tutorial completion 
As per the tutorial this is the next task to be completed. This is a bit tedious as there is no visual interaction, unlike sims, after all the sims isa fun game to play to a degree. Just do not drown them because the bloody sims comes back and leave water everywhere. Aslo i cant seem to find the commit button, please exuse me while i try and figure this out.
